# web_frame_2019
This is our web frameworks project which is based on a Library Management System. The look and feel is achieved by CSS,JS and HTML.
The backend functionality including login,signup and admin features is done using Django. In Django we've designed two models namely Login and Signup. Please check urls.py for all url patterns.
